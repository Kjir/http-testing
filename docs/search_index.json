For example, set a single variable: vcr_configure( dir = &quot;foobar/vcr_cassettes&quot; ) Or many at once: vcr_configure( dir = &quot;foobar/vcr_cassettes&quot;, record = &quot;all&quot; ) 3.3 Re-set to defaults vcr_configure_reset() 3.4 dir - directory of where cassettes are stored vcr_configure(dir = &quot;new/path&quot;) 3.5 record - record mode One of: ‘all’, ‘none’, ‘new_episodes’, ‘once’.

You can set to FALSE in which case vcr errors when a cassette is ejected and not all http interactions have been used. vcr_configure(allow_unused_http_interactions = FALSE) 3.8 serialize_with - which serializer to use Right now only option is “yaml” vcr_configure(serialize_with = &quot;yaml&quot;) 3.9 persist_with - which persister to use Right now only option is “FileSystem” vcr_configure(persist_with = &quot;FileSystem&quot;) 3.10 ignore requests 3.10.1 ignore_hosts - specify particular hosts to ignore vcr_configure(ignore_hosts = &quot;google.com&quot;) 3.10.2 ignore_localhost - ignore all localhost flavors vcr_configure(ignore_localhost = TRUE) 3.10.3 ignore_request - ignore any request for which function is true vcr_configure(ignore_request = function(x) x == 5) 3.11 uri_parser - which uri parser to use By default we use httr::parse_url, but you can use a different one. Remember to pass in the function quoted, and namespaced. vcr_configure(uri_parser = &quot;urltools::url_parse&quot;) 3.12 preserve_exact_body_bytes Some HTTP servers are not well-behaved and respond with invalid data. Set preserve_exact_body_bytes to TRUE to base64 encode the result body in order to preserve the bytes exactly as-is. vcr does not do this by default, since base64-encoding the string removes the human readibility of the cassette. vcr_configure(preserve_exact_body_bytes = TRUE) 3.13 allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette Determines how vcr treats HTTP requests that are made when no vcr cassette is in use. When TRUE, requests made when there is no vcr cassette in use will be allowed.

["record-modes.html", "Chapter 4 record modes 4.1 once 4.2 none 4.3 new_episodes 4.4 all", " Chapter 4 record modes 4.1 once The once record mode will: Replay previously recorded interactions. Record new interactions if there is no cassette file. Cause an error to be raised for new requests if there is a cassette file. It is similar to the new_episodes record mode, but will prevent new, unexpected requests from being made (i.e. because the request URI changed or whatever). once is the default record mode, used when you do not set one. 4.2 none The none record mode will: Replay previously recorded interactions. Cause an error to be raised for any new requests. This is useful when your code makes potentially dangerous HTTP requests. The none record mode guarantees that no new HTTP requests will be made. 4.3 new_episodes The new_episodes record mode will: Record new interactions. Replay previously recorded interactions. It is similar to the once record mode, but will always record new interactions, even if you have an existing recorded one that is similar (but not identical, based on the match_request_on option). 4.4 all The all record mode will: Record new interactions. Never replay previously recorded interactions. This can be temporarily used to force VCR to re-record a cassette (i.e. to ensure the responses are not out of date) or can be used when you simply want to log all HTTP requests. "],

You will generally want to use this matcher. The method matcher is used (along with the uri matcher) by default if you do not specify how requests should match. 5.2 matching on uri Use the uri request matcher to match requests on the request URI. The uri matcher is used (along with the method matcher) by default if you do not specify how requests should match. 5.3 matching on host Use the host request matcher to match requests on the request host. You can use this (alone, or in combination with path) as an alternative to uri so that non-deterministic portions of the URI are not considered as part of the request matching. 5.4 matching on path Use the path request matcher to match requests on the path portion of the request URI. You can use this (alone, or in combination with host) as an alternative to uri so that non-deterministic portions of the URI 5.5 matching on query string Use the query request matcher to match requests on the query string portion of the request URI.
