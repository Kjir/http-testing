# Preamble

This book is intended as a detailed guide to using a particular suite of packages for HTTP mocking and testing in R code and/or packages.

**Info**

* Source: <https://github.com/ropenscilabs/http-testing-book/>
* Issues/Bug reports: <https://github.com/ropenscilabs/http-testing-book/issues>
* pkgdown site for crul: <https://ropensci.github.io/crul/>
* pkgdown site for webmockr: <https://ropensci.github.io/webmockr/>
* pkgdown site for vcr: <https://ropensci.github.io/vcr/>

Packages

* `crul`: <https://github.com/ropensci/crul/>
* `webmockr`: <https://github.com/ropensci/webmockr/>
* `vcr`: <https://github.com/ropensci/vcr/>
* `curl`: <https://github.com/jeroen/curl/>

**Installation**

Stable version from CRAN

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("crul", "webmockr", "vcr", "httr"))
```

none of `crul`, `webmockr` or `vcr` have compiled code, but an underlying dependency of all of them, `curl` does. See [curl's README](https://github.com/jeroen/curl/#installation) for installation instructions in case you run into curl related problems.
